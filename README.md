# file-renamer
Renames all filestypes in the current folder and subfolders from "Non-standard" Microsoft files to .TXT witch is a "standard" Microsoft file.
I made this program because my school was migrating Microsoft accounts because of a region name change, and everything in onedrive which was not a "defauld" file type(.one .docx .doc .jpg .png etc), would be deleted and not migrated. I had a bunch of video files wich were not going to be migrated, so i made this program to change all file names to .txt, and back again to their original file type after the migration(coming soon).
